# Calculator
Simple calculator app built using jQuery and JavaScript. It behaves like your standard non-scientific calculator, allowing you to chain operations before hitting `=` to get the result.

I built this a while back for FreeCodeCamp but revisited it to add operator precedence. The calculator will now perform multiplication/division from left to right before doing subtraction. 

## Future Updates
* Update Bootstrap version from 3 to 4
* Update jQuery to latest stable release
* Add exponent, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, and other functions
* Add parentheses buttons
* Handle displaying extremely large or small numbers instead of having a digit limit
